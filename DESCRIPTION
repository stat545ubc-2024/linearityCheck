Description: The linearityCheck package displays the linear relationship between two variables,
  and computes the R-squared and p-value of the fit. The package includes the linearity_check function which plots two variables against each other, 
  overlays the linear fit, and displays the regression R-squared value on the ggplot. The linear regression model uses lm() with y ~ x.
